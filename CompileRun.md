# Introduction #

Short introduction for those who want to see the progress of this **really little** project.

# Details #

This project is created with the help of [Netbeans 6.0 editor](http://www.netbeans.org). The project requires _mobility_ plugin downloaded with the Netbeans.

How to download the project is described [here](http://code.google.com/p/pinklife/source/checkout).

After you download the project, just open the project using Netbeans. To run it for the first time, hit F6.

**The project is just being written; there is absolutely no guarantee it's going to work. There is even no guarantee I will finish it.** The only thing you can do is to see my idea of such a simple program.

Have a nice day;-)
