A small 'simulation' game with J2ME in mind where user must take care after a creature to make it happy.

At current development stage [this page](CompileRun.md) can show you **how to run the project**. It is generally finished - it is **really simple** though. There are still (and always will be) many different things that can be implemented.

Why is it written? Because:
  1. I haven't seen such a game for J2ME
  1. So others could see how easy it is to write such a game ;-)
